# Template for HL7 Switzerland FHIR Implementation Guide
This is a template for creating a [HL7 Switzerland](https://www.hl7.ch/) FHIR implementation guide ([CI Build](http://build.fhir.org/ig/ahdis/ch-ig/branches/master/index.html)). Sample resources are integrated as fsh files (`ch-ig\input\fsh`).   
This *CH IG* implementation guide is dependent on CH Core (and therefore also on CH EPR Term), which describe the Swiss specific context, especially related to the Swiss electronic patient record. If this dependency cannot be used, it can be removed.

**FSH (FHIR Shorthand)**    
To set up a FHIR Shorthand (FSH) implementation guide use this template or see the instructions [here](https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/project/). Don't forget to [install SUSHI](https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/installation/). ([CI Build](http://build.fhir.org/ig/ahdis/ch-ig/branches/master/index.html))  

Further supporting information on FSH:
* [Documentation of the FHIR Shorthand language standard](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/shorthand/)
* [FSH School](https://fshschool.org/): The place to learn and try FHIR Shorthand!
* [FSH Cheat Sheet](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/FSHQuickReference.pdf)

**GoFSH:**      
Using [GoFSH](https://fshschool.org/docs/gofsh/), you can turn existing FHIR artifacts into FSH definitions.

GoFSH is executed from the command line. GoFSH requires that these files be JSON. An example form of the GoFSH execution command is as follows:
```
gofsh ./input/resources/structuredefinition -o ./input/fsh -d ch.fhir.ig.ch-core@2.0.0 -d ch.fhir.ig.ch-epr-term@2.0.4 -d ihe.mhd.fhir@current
```

## Creating your own repository from this template
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the file list, click **Use this template**. 
3. Use the **Owner** drop-down menu, and select the account you want to own the repository. 
4. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description. 
5. Choose to make the repository either public or private.
6. Optionally, if you want to set up a fish-only implementation guide, select **Include all branches**.
7. Click **Create repository from template**.

See also https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template.

## Adapt the template to your own implementation guide
* Replace **ig** (e.g. *ch-**ig**-patient* &rarr; *ch-**name**-patient*) at all appropriate places with the desired **name** of the implementation guide:  
    * Rename all files
    * Rename file content
* Change the content of the file README.md
* Change the value of the publisher (incl. contact), logo, links etc. from 'HL7 Switzerland' to the publisher responsible for this implementation guide

## Building the IG
* Get the latest IG publisher from https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/releases/latest/download/publisher.jar. 
   * Make sure you are always working with the lastest publisher 
* Put the publisher.jar in the main directory.
* A local build of the IG can be generated by running `JAVA -jar publisher.jar -ig ig.ini` at the command line.
* See the output:
   * Validation results (QA): .\ch-ig\output\qa.html (link is displayed in the command line)
   * Implementation guide: .\ch-ig\output\index.html (replace qa with index)

# Get the implementation guide running 
## Get the existing git repository
* If you haven't already done so, create a local *GitHub* folder on your computer (e.g. `C:\Users\username\Documents\GitHub`).
* Open a terminal in VSC (Terminal > New Terminal)
* Navigate to the local *GitHub* folder in the terminal (`cd .\Documents\`, `cd .\GitHub\`)
* Then clone the repository via the terminal: `git clone https://github.com/ahdis/ch-ig.git`
* Open the folder of the repository in VSC (File > Open Folder...)
* Navigate to this repository in the therminal (`cd .\ch-ig\ `)

## Install the FHIR IG publisher
* In VSC press *F1* or *Ctrl+Shift+P*
* Type following command in the field: *FHIR update Java Validator and IGPublisher*

## Build the IG
* In VSC press *F1* or *Ctrl+Shift+P*
* Type following command in the field: *FHIR run IGPublisher*
* Copy the link from the result in your terminal in a web browser (`file:///C:/Users/username/Documents/GitHub/ch-ig/qa.html`)
